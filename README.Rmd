# htmlRd
[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/RDocTaskForce/htmlRd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RDocTaskForce/htmlRd)
[![Coverage status](https://codecov.io/gh/RDocTaskForce/htmlRd/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/RDocTaskForce/htmlRd?branch=master)

The goal of htmlRd is to provide methods for converting
[htmltools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=htmltools)
shiny.tag objects into Rd.

## Installation

You can install the released version of htmlRd from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("htmlRd")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
html <- with(htmltools::tags, {
    div( h1("Converting HTML to Rd")
       , p("Currently "
          , code(a("htmlRd", href="https://github.com/RDocTaskForce/htmlRd"))
          , " only supports HTML tags found in the "
          , em("body"), " of the document."
          )
       )
})
html
```

```{r}
toRd(html)
```
